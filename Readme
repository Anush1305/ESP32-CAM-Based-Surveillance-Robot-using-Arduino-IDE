INTRODUCTION:
The ESP32 CAM Based Surveillance Robot using Arduino IDE is designed to enhance security through real-time video monitoring and autonomous navigation. By
integrating the ESP32 CAM module, which combines a microcontroller with a camera, the robot is capable of streaming live video and transmitting it via Wi-Fi
to remote users. This allows for effective surveillance of areas that are difficult to monitor manually. The system can detect motion and provide instant alerts,
making it a valuable tool for both security and remote monitoring applications. Future enhancements may include integrating AI for advanced object detection and 
improving navigation capabilities. This project demonstrates the practical application of ESP32 CAM technology in creating a costeffective and
versatile surveillance solution.
